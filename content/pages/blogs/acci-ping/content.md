This story starts back in University, there's a few very popular student streets in which private
accommodation is filled to the brim with naive students, once upon a time I was one of these students.

At the time I frequently played [Dota 2](https://www.dota2.com/home) which if you haven't heard of already,
well done, stay that way. For this story you needn't know more than it's a multiplayer game over the internet.
Which brings me to Virgin Media, when I moved into this private accommodation I remember a conversation with
my new flat mates along the lines of:

> Lexer747:blockquote-blue
> Hey, which internet provider should we go with for the year?

<br>

> Lexer747:blockquote-cyan
> Lets go have a look at some comparison sites

<br>

> Lexer747:blockquote-blue
> [...]

<br>

> Lexer747:blockquote-cyan
> Wow Virgin sure looks like a great deal, great speeds (~70Mb/s down) and competitively priced.
>
> Compared to the others which charge more for worse speeds, it's a no-brainer!

<br>

> Lexer747:blockquote-blue
> Sounds good.

Some more pre-amble

Code examples:

```go
err := runTemplating()
if err != nil {
	exit(err)
}
func foobar(x int) any {
	panic("unimplemented")
}
```
